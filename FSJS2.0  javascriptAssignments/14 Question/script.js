// Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript? 
// Create a program which checks that the given number is even or odd.


var number = 10

if(number % 2 == 0)
console.log("entered number is even");
else
console.log("entered number is odd");
